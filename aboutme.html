  <p align="left">Game Jawns Inc is me, <strong>Mike</strong>. I'm from Pennsylvania, working on this game in my spare time from my day job as a programmer. I like punk rock and video games.<br><br>
  I have been learning game dev in Godot and animation/drawing in order to make a game that combines my most nostalgic games (like ps1 RPGs) with my other favorites.<hr>
  <p align="left">I gave myself lots of time to learn and focus on the same project. It's been fun to piece together and learn everything that's needed to make a game.<br><br>
  I've been working on JawnRPG for about 3 years, and I'm finally getting to a point where the systems I've worked on/thrown away/rewrote are starting to mesh with each other.<hr>
  <p align="center">Planning on releasing this game on Steam and trying to get lots of people to enjoy it. If you've got any thoughts you can contact me at <strong>gamejawnsinc</strong> twitter/𝚐𝚖𝚊𝚒𝚕 or <strong>game_jawns_inc</strong> on reddit.<hr>
